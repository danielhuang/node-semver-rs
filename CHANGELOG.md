# `node-semver` Release Changelog

<a name="2.0.1"></a>
## 2.0.1 (2022-09-04)

### Bug Fixes

* **satisfies:** Fix `.satisfies` bug for higher major/minor/path pre-release versions (#8) ([ee8376e7](https://github.com/felipesere/node-semver-rs/commit/ee8376e7f060cb19829e5e0e62c1a729cf4653f8))
* **range:** handle partial `=` ranges, which was causing panics (#7) ([f0eef040](https://github.com/felipesere/node-semver-rs/commit/f0eef04032cf1fe7ed341a110897005c31e61ead))

## 2.0.0 (2021-09-26)

This is an almost full rewrite of the Range parser to make it work much more
closely to how the JS `node-semver` parser works. Not by using regex,
fortunately.

As such, this is potentially a pretty breaking change, but it's a breaking
change in the direction of compatibility.

Please file issues for any compatibility issues you find and we'll fix them
asap!

### Features

* **loose:** rewrite to support loose mode better (#5) ([20fb02d8](https://github.com/felipesere/node-semver-rs/commit/20fb02d882caf12439f115277ec3ca587ad1e62e))
  * **BREAKING CHANGE**: This accepts (and rejects) some semver strings that
    were valid before, and I'm not comfortable just calling thos e bugs. It
    also vastly reduces the number of "bad" semver parses by outright throwing
    out bad-looking data without warning you. This is literally what the
    JavaScript node-semver does. And so...
